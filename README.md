# Approximations for the Wright-Fisher model of population dynamics under natural selection at two linked loci
Source code is implemented for approximations for the Wright-Fisher model of population dynamics under natural selection at two linked loci, and the preprint is available at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.213769v1 for the diffusion approxiamtion and https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.213769v1 for the parametric approxmation.
