# Approximations for the Wright-Fisher model of population dynamics under natural selection at two linked loci

Source code is implemented for approximations for the Wright-Fisher model of population dynamics under natural selection at two linked loci.

The preprint for the diffusion approximation is available at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.213769v1.

The preprint for the moment-based approximation is available at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.213769v1.
