# Approximations for the Wright-Fisher model of population dynamics under selection at two linked loci

The source code is implemented for approximations for the Wright-Fisher model of population dynamics subject to selection at a pair of linked loci.

The preprint for the diffusion approximation is available at https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.21.213769.

The preprint for the moment-based approximation is available at https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.01.424882.
